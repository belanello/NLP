
## Next Word Prediction 

Whenever we type texts on search engines, word documents, mobile phone apps etc, applications often show us possible next words we are going to type in. In this project, using the large text dataset sourced from twitter posts, news and blogs, try to build the predictive model of English texts that works in the same way. Details about data used, algorithm and accuracy are in presentation slide below.
